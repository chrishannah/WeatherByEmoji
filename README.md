# WeatherByEmoji
Easily check the weather and view it as a simple Emoji. You can either let it get the weather for your current location, or enter a location yourself.

# How does it work?
It's a basic static HTML/CSS/JS website, that uses the [simpleWeather.js framework](http://simpleweatherjs.com) to get the weather [data from Yahoo](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html#codes). It's all pretty simple, but it's just for fun.
